** Image embedding
12.7 Images
An image is a link to an image file117 that does not have a description part, for example

./img/cat.jpg
If you wish to define a caption for the image (see Captions) and maybe a label for internal cross references (see Internal Links), make sure that the link is on a line by itself and precede it with CAPTION and keywords as follows:

#+CAPTION: This is the caption for the next figure link (or table)
#+NAME:   fig:SED-HR4049
[[./img/a.jpg]]
Such images can be displayed within the buffer with the following command:

C-c C-x C-v (org-toggle-inline-images)
Toggle the inline display of linked images. When called with a prefix argument, also display images that do have a link description. You can ask for inline images to be displayed at startup by configuring the variable org-startup-with-inline-images118.
